# Campbook Processing

This is a very small script that I wrote for CYLC in 2019. The format of the campbook is at least a 1/4 inch margin, black and white, and in a pdf. I didn't want to do it by hand, so here we are 142 lines of code later!

## Installation

1. Close Photoshop
2. Go to the photoshop scripts folder:

    ```bash
    C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC [Photoshop Version(ie. 2018)]\Presets\Scripts
    ```

3. Just copy `Campbook.jsx` into that folder
4. Then open Photoshop!

## Usage

1. Make a new file that is 8.5x11 inches, portrait orientation, and 300 ppi
2. Make whatever you want on that document!
3. Go to `File > Scripts > Campbook`
4. After clicking on `Campbook`, the program should run, and when finished, it will display `Campbook Page Processing: Success!`
5. It will output a pdf named `Output.pdf` in the same location of the original photoshop file, and you're done!
